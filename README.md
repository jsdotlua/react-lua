## About the Project

React Lua is a comprehensive translation of upstream [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/react) from JavaScript into Lua, and is highly-turned for both performance and correctness.

When possible, upstream flowtype and definitely-typed types have been translated into Luau type annotations. The major and minor version of React Lua is aligned to the upstream used for the translation, except where noted. Due to the close nature of the two implementations, most article, video, or blog posts that gives React JS advice can be applied to React Lua -- modulo language differences, of course.

## About this Fork

This repository is a fork of [`roblox/react-lua`](https://github.com/roblox/react-lua) with the intention of being the Roblox and global Lua community go-to for React in Lua. Roblox's repository is a read-only mirror of their internal project, and as such cannot be contributed to by the community. They have not published React to any public package registry and have not made alterations for easier use by the community.

### Original Project Authors

Roblox has removed commit author history in their public mirror, which removes credit for the original project authors. Below is a non-exhaustive list of those who originally worked on the project, in no particular order:

## Status

The [react repo](https://github.com/facebook/react) is a monorepo with a number of member projects in its `packages` folder, managed by a Yarn workspace. Below is a description of each of those package, its status in React Lua, and how it likely fits into our future plans.

## Deviations from [Roact](https://github.com/roblox/roact)

This repo is meant to supplant the `Roact` project, which is an open-source project that currently powers many Roblox projects. Our goal is to be as compatible as possible with Roact.

With that in mind, however, there will still be a small number of behavioral deviations that make the transition from existing Roact smoother, or account for nuances of the Roblox ecosystem:

* Stable Keys: Aligned Roact will allow table keys to be used as stable keys for child elements, equivalent to the behavior relied upon in Roact today
* Context: Roact's deprecated `_context` feature will not be present in React Lua; users will have to switch to the `createContext` feature, which is present in both Roact and React Lua and is semantically equivalent
* Class Component Refs: React Lua will allow refs provided to class components (referred to in Roact documentation as "stateful components") to point to the actual component instance. This is not supported in Roact, and there may be changes around the `Roact.Ref` prop key to support this with minimal disruption
* Bindings: We intend to keep `createBindings` and `joinBindings`, a feature unique to Roact and [documented here](https://roblox.github.io/roact/api-reference#roactcreatebinding)

See [this document](DEVIATIONS.md) for details about any deviations and the design and refactoring efforts being proposed to address them.

## Contribution Guidelines

* Try to keep the directory structure, file name/location, and code symbol names aligned with React upstream. At the top of the mirrored files, put a comment in this format that includes the specific hash of the version of the file you're mirroring:

```lua
-- ROBLOX upstream https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/9abc2785cb070148d64fae81e523246b90b92016/packages/scheduler/src/Scheduler.js
```

* If you have a deviation from upstream code logic for Lua-specific reasons (1-based array indices, etc) put a comment above the deviated line:

```lua
-- ROBLOX deviation: use explicit nil check instead of falsey
```

* For deviations due to Lua language differences (no spread operator) that don't involve changing the logic, don't put a deviation comment. Just use the appropriate equivalent from LuauPolyfill and other utility libraries.

* For files that are new and Roblox-specific, use the file name: `Timeout.roblox.lua`

* and for Roblox-specific tests, use the file name format: `Timeout.roblox.spec.lua`
