 * Use invariant() to assert state which your program assumes to be true.
 *
 * Provide sprintf-style format (only %s is supported) and arguments
 * to provide information about what broke and what you were
 * expecting.
 *
 * The invariant message will be stripped in production, but the invariant
 * will remain to ensure logic does not differ in production.
