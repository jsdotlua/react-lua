-- deviation: this lets us have the same functionality as in React, without
-- having something like Babel to inject a different implementation of
-- console.warn and console.error into the code
-- Instead of using `LuauPolyfill.console`, React internals should use this
-- wrapper to be able to use consoleWithStackDev in dev mode
